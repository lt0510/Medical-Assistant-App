# Medical-Assistant-App 
Medical Assistance application (Group-13) is a telemedicine application which assists in the remote delivery of healthcare services like consultations, this is a part of the course project under CS 345/346 - Software Engineering Lab.
The COVID-19 has shown the world the importance of telemedicine. More and more people 
have started to prefer short online consultations over physically visiting clinics and being 
exposed to microbes. Moreover, working individuals might find it hard to spend time waiting 
in queues at both clinics and pharmacies. Taking inspiration from the recently introduced 
telemedicine service by the IITG Hospital, this application aims to extend this service to a 
broader audience and include other features.
The features of this app can include: 
  ● Provisions to schedule consultations with various doctors offline and online. 
  ● Live video consultations for routine checkups, which is time-efficient for both doctors and 
    patients. Only symptomatic patients can be called to the clinic; reducing crowds there. 
  ● Doctors can provide e-prescriptions that can easily be saved for the future and have 
    improved legibility. 
  ● Implement medicine intake remainders, the older generation and busy ones can benefit 
    from reminders for medicine dosage. 
  ● Provision to primarily verify/check if the individual has the disease or not by assessing 
    symptoms for frequent and common diseases (by asking a series of questions to the user).
