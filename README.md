# Medical-Assistant-App 
Medical Assistance application (Group-13) is a telemedicine application which assists in the remote delivery of healthcare services like consultations, this is a part of the course project under CS 345/346 - Software Engineering Lab.
The COVID-19 has shown the world the importance of telemedicine. More and more people 
have started to prefer short online consultations over physically visiting clinics and being 
exposed to microbes. Moreover, working individuals might find it hard to spend time waiting 
in queues at both clinics and pharmacies. Taking inspiration from the recently introduced 
telemedicine service by the IITG Hospital, this application aims to extend this service to a 
broader audience and include other features.
The features of this app can include: 
- Provisions to schedule consultations with various doctors offline and online. 
- Live video consultations for routine checkups, which is time-efficient for both doctors and patients. Only symptomatic patients can be called to the clinic; reducing crowds there. 
- Doctors can provide e-prescriptions that can easily be saved for the future and have improved legibility. 
- Implement medicine intake remainders, the older generation and busy ones can benefit 
from reminders for medicine dosage. 
- Provision to primarily verify/check if the individual has the disease or not by assessing 
symptoms for frequent and common diseases (by asking a series of questions to the user).  

In this porject we tried learning the Software Development Life Cycle (by doing most of the stages). We did the porject as following parts:
  - **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**: Created SRS document which contains Hierarchical Depiction of Functional Requirements, Functional Requirements and Contextual Enquiry
  - **Prototyping and it's Evaluation**: Created a prototype for the Calendar Application (medium fidelity, vertical prototype precisely) using Figma [Click here to see it](https://www.figma.com/file/f04YRmu6rqiqVM4IySTpZY/SWE-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1). Later we performed evaluation using the cognitive walkthrough technique (Expert Evaluation type) by creating few Task Scenarios and made summary of the findings from the report.
  - **Code (System) Design**: Created a Data FLow Diagram for the Medical-Assistant App, by providing description of the design, also shows how the functions described in the SRS can be implemented. Created an ER Diagram to show the Data Desing and Description, which helps in expressing the internal structure, organization and relationships in data stores. (Additionally to understand object oriecntede approach, created UML for calendar app by creating few Use Case Diagrams, Domain Modelling, Sequence Diagrams, Class Diagrams)
  - **Coding and Code Testing**: Created a mapping between module/submodules in the DFD and the corresponding functions in code (including code of few functiions). Implemented Black Box Testing by designing test cases through examination of the input/output values for the functions included earlier in both approaches of Equivalence Class Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis. Also, implemented White Box Testing, in this test cases are designed using knowledge of internal structure of software code, only created for Path Coverage Test using the control flow graph (CFG).
